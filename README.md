macOS-Automation-Scripts

This year 2023, I have successfully completed my secondary education as a computer scientist specializing in systems engineering in the summer. :)

During my internship, I wrote automation scripts for macOS. 
My goal is to be able to share my "simple" scripts and maybe even help further. Since I know how time-consuming it can be to create a script.
Perhaps these also serve as auxiliary material to be developed even better.

I would also like to add that this was not perfectly solved, but it works for the requirements I needed to that time.

## Never change your running system
Therefore, I am also open for suggestions or information that enrich my knowledge and allow me to develop further.
