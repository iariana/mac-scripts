macOS-Automation-Scripts

I am currently in my second training as an IT systems technician. During this time, I have come into contact with various projects, which has also allowed me to create and implement script automations. My goal is to be able to share my "simple" scripts and maybe even help further. Since I know how time-consuming something like this can be :)
