macOS-Automation-Scripts

I am currently in my second training as an IT systems technician. 
During that time, I have come into contact with various projects, which has also allowed me to create and implement script automations. 
My goal is to be able to share my "simple" scripts and maybe even help further. Since I know how time-consuming something like this can be :)

I would also like to add that this was not perfectly solved, but it works for the requirements

## The motto is here: Never change your running system
Therefore, I am also open for suggestions or information that enrich my knowledge and allow me to develop further.
